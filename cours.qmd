## Fist, who are we ?

- **Me** : somewhere in the computational social sciences
- **You** ?
    - What software/OS are you using ?
    - Do you know how to use command line interfaces ?
    - Have you heard about git/github a little ?


## Starting point

<br>

**You are going to carry out a collaborative project with programming & data**

<br>

How to ensure a collaborative project involving programming/data analysis runs smoothly?

## Goals


- Some best practices for collaboration around programming
- Get familiar with GitHub
- Start the structure of a project
- Available resources
- Discuss about coding practices

*This session will be language agnostique*

## Why using it in general ?

::: {.callout-warning title="Disclamer"}
You don't have to know everything

- There are numerous tutorials
- The general philosophy comes first
- Nevertheless, it can be very useful
:::

## What does it mean to code for data science ?

- A Set of Practices
    - From script to software
    - From data scientist to computer scientist
- A Set of Technologies
    - Different languages, software, etc.
- A Set of More or Less Interdependent Artifacts
    - Files, texts, folders, application
    - Intermediate, final

## With the challenge of working together

- Sharing storage 
- Communicating over various channels
- Keeping track of various versions
- ...

## So, what possibily could go wrong ?

- Different coding styles leading to chaos
- Asynchronous contributions : conflicts ...
- Profusion of versions
- Increased likelihood of errors
- ...

**How to avoid problems (at least some) ?**


## A classic situation {style="text-align: center;"}

![](./img/finalfinal.png){width=600 fig-align="center"}

There are solutions against that...


## First rule : Structuring a Project

- Separate code from data
    - Different logic
    - Different tools
- Document / Comment your productions
    - Be explicit
- Modularize : create distinct elements

## Second rule : a common file system

- data in a data directory
- scripts in a script directory
- ...

**What are the other elements of a project ?**

# Next step : code management

## What is code versionning ?

- *Option 1* : there is only one document and you send each version by email
    - slow and a lots of version
- *Option 2* : there is only one document online on the cloud and you work on it
    - difficulty to keep track of the versions
    - can be chaos
- *Option 3* : each contribution is clearly identified in a shared file system with clear rules of addition

**Entering Git & Github**

## Code versioning is old

- Tools like RCS, CVS, or Subversion around since the early 1980s
    - Some readings : [Industrial public goods: A genesis of the insertion of free software in Silicon Valley, Gabriel Alcaras, Sociologie du travail, 2020](https://journals.openedition.org/sdt/33283)
- Leading the way to distributed tools

**Somehow, it is a meta file organisation that keeps track of contributions and force you to (some) good practices**

## Git and the Linux history

- An history born from the free software movement
- A bazar of contribution
    - No vertical integration
- Linux Torvald benevolent dictator
    - [Obligatory point of passage](https://blog.brachiosoft.com/en/posts/git/)
- The big question :
    - How to collabore on code

## Git {style="text-align: center;"}

![](./img/gitxkcd.png)

[Credits : xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

## How does it work

- A base unit : the repository containing everything
- A network of contribution with a unique id
- Everything recorded
- Possibility to have parallel versions

**A world in itself...**


## What is Git exactly ?

Git is a command line tool which allow to :

- add modifications to this structure
- manage changes (back, forward, fusions)
- natively installed on unix systems

Over time

- embedded in other tools (VS code)
    - [There are GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
- became an infrastructure of programming practices & OS

````
$ git
````

## Workflow {style="text-align: center;"}

![](./img/git-committing.svg)

## Small demo with the slides

- [First configure git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup.html)
- Then, initializing a git repo (CLI is useful)
    - `git init` => a .git directory
    - `git status`
    - `git add FILE` => staging area
    - `git diff`
    - `git commit` -m "MESSAGE"
    - `git log`

## Git messages {style="text-align: center;"}

Clear messages if possible...

![](./img/git_commit_2x.png)

[Credit: xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1296/)

## Possibility to see the diff

- with specific commits
- with specific files
    - `git diff IDCOMIT FILE`

## Possibility to restore

- `git restore FILE`
- `git reset --hard`

## 

::: {.callout-important title="Code & Data"}
Git is not designed to version data

Other solutions as [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for research.

# From local to cloud

## Github genesis

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- A company built on git in 2008 
    - Bought by Microsoft in 2018 (mutation of OS)
- Basically : Git on cloud plus services
    - Centralized repository
- A system of rights to access (maintainer, contributor, etc.)
- A new grammar of how to contribute
    - push, pull, pull request, etc.

::::

## A plateforme for projects

- A central repository that connect developers and users
    - a "community"
- Allow contributions to be visible
- Allow discussions

Why to use it ?

- Reproducibility
- Transparency
- Ease of collaboration
- Communicating your work
- Never lose a file
- Work from multiple machines seemlessly

## Github : a social media

- A showcase of projects
    - Stars
- A platform to stay updated
    - Versions & contributions
- A space for socializing & exchanging
    - Issues
    - Communities

## Let's have a look : the most famous repository

- [Most famous repository](https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking)
- [Map of Github](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-github/#2/0/0) 

<!-- Would be interesting to dig in the existing map of github -->

## A lot of services

- Actions (Continuous integrations)
- Github pages
- Wiki
- ...

## Github is not alone

Other open-source code-sharing platform ("forges" in French)

- SourceForge
- Bitbucket
- Gitlab
- Gitti

## Diversity of uses

- CLI
- In other tools
    - VS Code
    - R Studio
    - Jupyter
- GUI 
    - Github Desktop

## Let's have a look with CLI

Let's put our slides on Github

- git init / git clone
- **git pull**
- git status
- git remote -v
- git add
- git commit
- **git push**
- ...

## Authentification

It can sometime be tricky...

- HTTPS
- SSH

[How to setup SSH keys](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github.html)

## Initialize your Github repository

Hands one :  create your first repository

- create one from Github
- modify the github README
- clone it on your computer
- make a modification + push

## Give permission

- Give permission to a colleague to modify your repository
- Make him/her do a change
- Then, try yourself to make a change

## [Advanced point] How to resolve conflicts 

When the history of different versions of a repository diverge, there are solutions;

- merge/rebase strategies : keep the modifications and arbitrate on conflicts
- brute force : you can erase (not advised)

**Sometime, it can be trick**

## 2 ways {style="text-align: center;"}

![](./img/rebasemerge.png)

## It can be messy {style="text-align: center;"}


![](./img/git-merge.gif)


## [Advanced point] .gitignore file

Possibility to exclude files from the tracking

- Data
- Config files
- Private information

Add them in a file called .gitignore

## [Advanced point] branches

- Not only one succession of commits
- But different series in parallel
- And the possibility to merge from one branch to another

Why ? Test things without modifying the principal branch for instance

## [Advanced point] pull requests

It is a proposed change to a codebaseWhen a pull request is created

- Made on an independant branch
- Proposed to review for the repository
- Possibility to discuss on it

# Your project

## How to prepare your project

- Choose a file system easy to use
    - Adapt it if needed
- Set up a repository
- Discuss on how you want to work
    - Every one can modify
    - Choose a maintainer

## Our cookie-cutter for the project

- A Github organisation
- A blank repository playing the part of a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/policyinaction/cookiecutter-project
)

## Create a fork of the repository

- Fork the repository 
- Give it a name
- Change the readme with your name


# Other aspects

## Use Onyxia

- [GENES Data Lab](https://onyxia.lab.groupe-genes.fr/account/user-interface), based on a plateforme developed by INSEE
- Possibility to create temporary services
- Triple separation
    - Code
    - Computation
    - Data (S3)
- Add a token in Onyxia
    - *small demo with Jupyter*

## Style

- "Code is read more often than it is written.
Code should always be written in a way that promotes readability."

*Guido von Rossum - PEP8 Python*

## Data

- Where to store them ?
- What are the best format ?
- What is a good metadata ?

## Software

- How to choose between open and commercial software ?
- How to keep track of the versions ?

## [Advanced] Virtual environment
